    "\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, \n",
    "you may do so, but must justify your choice.\n",
    "2. Make sure you use the `data` folder provided in the repository in read-only mode. (Or alternatively, be sure you \n",
    "donâ€™t change any of the files.)\n",
    "3. Be sure to provide a textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, the solution you \n",
    "implemented, and explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice.\n",
    "4. For questions containing the **/Discuss:/** prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation\n",
    " (**in markdown**).\n",
    "5. Back up any hypotheses and claims with data, since this is an important aspect of the course.\n",
    "6. Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code. Your repo should have a \n",
    "single notebook (plus the required data files) in the *master/main* branch. If there are multiple notebooks present, \n",
    "we will **not grade** anything.\n",
    "7. We will **not run your notebook for you**! Rather, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results \n",
    "contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. \n",
    "Thus, be sure to hand in a **fully-run and evaluated notebook**. In order to check whether everything looks as intended,\n",
    " you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "8. In continuation to the previous point, interactive plots, such as those generated using `plotly`, should be \n",
    "**strictly avoided**!\n",
    "9. Make sure to print results or dataframes that confirm you have properly addressed the task.\n",

    "In this homework, we will analyze data from A/B tests of headlines conducted by Upworthy from January 2013 to April 2015 to study whether the language used in the headline determines the number of people that will read the associated news piece. The homework contains four tasks: in task 1, we will process the data; in task 2, we will extract meaningful signals from the data; in task 3, we will test whether the language of headlines impacts their success; and in task 4, we will explore the heterogeneity of this effects (e.g., does it vary through time?).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is an A/B test?** \n",
    "A/B tests are experiments that compare two scenarios (e.g., scenario A vs. scenario B). \n",
    "They test subjects' responses to each of the variants to determine which is more effective ([read more about A/B tests on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing)). \n",
    "A/B tests allow us to draw conclusions about the different scenarios by randomizing exposure to them, e.g., one could flip a coin and assign a user to scenario A if it lands heads and to B if it lands tails. \n",
    "Since exposure is randomized, we can be confident that the scenarios are the sole explanation for statistically significant differences in subjects' responses (if they exist). \n",
    "In theory, A/B testing refers to an experiment that compares two scenarios; however, in practice, the term is also used when we compare multiple scenarios (e.g., A vs. B vs. C), although the more precise terminology would be to call such an experiment a \"multinomial test.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How were A/B tests used by Upworthy?** \n",
    "Upworthy used A/B testing to increase news readership, conducting experiments for each published news piece. \n",
    "In each experiment, they created multiple \"packages\" of stimuli, varying headlines, images, excerpts, and ledes for the same news piece. \n",
    "Different \"packages\" were shown on their (now defunct) website to engage users with the news pieces they produced. Upworthy found \"the best\" package by conducting A/B tests, showing different packages to different users, and measuring how often users clicked on each version. \n",
    "Below, we show three \"packages\" used by Upworthy in an experiment, each with a different headline for the same news piece. \n",
    "Upworthy randomized users that visited their website saw one of the three versions of the headline below. Then, they measured the percentage of times users in each scenario clicked to read the news. \n",
    "The headline with the highest percentage of clicks per view (click through rate) was then declared the \"winner\" and became the default for all visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example A/B test](example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " ### **Where does this data come from?** \n",
    " \n",
    " From a paper [1].\n",
    "\n",

    "- **News piece:** A news article. In the dataset considered, these were all produced by Upworthy.\n",
    "- **Package:** The set of visual stimuli inviting the user to read an article. The figure above shows a package with a headline and an image. At times, there was an excerpt of the article also shown in the package and/or the lede, i.e., [\"the introductory section of a news story that is intended to entice the reader to read the full story.\"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/bury-the-lede-versus-lead#:~:text=In%20journalism%2C%20the%20lede%20refers,machines%20began%20disappearing%20from%20newsrooms.)\n",
    "- **Experiment:** Each experiment is an A/B test (or multinomial test, to be more precise) comparing how users reacted to different \"packages.\" Experiments measured two things: 1) how many users were shown each package; and 2) how many individuals clicked each package.\n",

    "## Task 1: Getting familiar with the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to conduct initial analyses to understand the data and process it in a way that will allow us to more easily answer our key question: *how does the language of a headline determine its success?*\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 Load the data into memory using pandas and print the first lines to get a sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Each experiment comparing different versions of the same news piece (\"packages\") has a unique identifier (`clickability_test_id` column). \n",
    "Calculate how many different experiments were conducted in this dataset and, on average, how many packages were considered per experiment. \n",
    "Last, plot the distribution of packages per experiment with a visualization of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3 A common way to measure success in online A/B tests is what is called \"the clickthrough rate.\"\n",
    "Given that often A/B tests are created to find what engages users (here, \"packages\" of headlines, images, etc), we would expect that a \"good\" package makes people click often. \n",
    "Create a column named `ctr` by dividing the number of clicks a package received (`clicks` column) by the number of impressions it received (`impressions` column).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4 Packages varied any combination of the headline (`headline` column), the excerpt (`excerpt`), the first sentence of the article (`lede`), and the image that illustrates the news piece (`eyecatcher_id`, a hash per image). \n",
    "But we want to isolate the effect of the headline on the clickthrough rate. To do that, create a new dataframe where you filter all experiments where only one headline is present. \n",
    "Print the length of this new dataframe and how many experiments were discarded in the filtering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.5 For comparison, repeat the procedure described in **T1.4** with the `eyecatcher_id` column, i.e., create a dataframe considering only experiments that vary the image. \n",
    "Again, print the length of this new dataframe and how many experiments were discarded in the filtering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.6 **Discuss:** Considering the answers to questions **T1.4** and **T1.4**, what can we say about the different versions of the news tested by Upworthy?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.7 For our subsequent analysis, we want to compare the causal effect of headlines on the success of a news piece. \n",
    "For that, we can compare pairs of packages with the same `eyecatcher_id`, `lede`, and `excerpt`, but different `headlines`.\n",
    "Note that this means that if an experiment considered 5 different headlines and did not vary any other stimulus, we would have 5C2 (i.e., 5 choose 2, 10) pairs to consider.\n",
    "Create a dataset where:\n",
    "- each row corresponds to a pair of packages with different `headline` but the same `eyecatcher_id`, `lede`, and `excerpt`. \n",
    "- there are columns containing the headlines of each of the news versions (`headline1`, `headline2`) and the clickthrough rate of each of the news versions (`ctr1`, `ctr2`). \n",
    "- the columns `headline1` and `ctr1` contain the data associated with the news version with the highest clickthrough rate. Print the first columns of your newly created dataframe, as well as its length.\n",
    "-  the columns where the two news pieces had exactly the same clickthrough rate should be filtered out (this is for simplicity's sake).\n",
    "-  the column `date_created` contains the date when the news version with the highest clickthrough rate was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.8 To get a sense of the impact of headline change, measure the average difference per pair between the most clicked-through (`ctr1`) and the least clicked-through headline (`ctr2`), as well as the average clickthrough rate for the least clicked through headline (`ctr2`). \n",
    "\n",
    "1.9 **Discuss:** Considering your answer to **T1.8**, and assuming the average differences in clickthrough rates between pairs are statistically significant, do you think that headlines are impactful in the news business? Justify with the data."

    "4.1 Create a plot where you depict the monthly average number of words in winner and loser headlines. Consider only headlines created after April 2013 (the month of April inclusive). Include also bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals; here, you can use a third-party implementation if you want. Finally, recall that we created a column `date_created` which captures the creation of the winner headline; you can consider this date to correspond to the date of the creation of the A/B test.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 Produce similar plots to each pronoun category, as well as for positive and negative sentiment. Here, unlike in **T4.1**, depict the month averages pooled across winner and loser headlines (i.e., for each month, you calculate the average across both winners and loser headlines).\n",
    "Create all these plots in a single figure with no more than 11 inches of width and 11 inches of height. Again, consider only headlines created after April 2013 (the month of April inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 **Discuss:** Has the type of headline Upworthy used in their A/B tests changed with time? Are these changes likely to be producing more or less engaging headlines? Justify.\n",

    "\n",
    "4.5 Let's examine if the effects observed remained the same throughout the study period. Use an appropriate methodology  of your choice to determine if the effects observed in **T3.8** (length, each category of pronouns, positive words, and negative words) were different in $t_1$ and $t_2$. Here, note that we are considering \"at least one positive outcome\" to be the manifestation of an underlying effect, thus significance level must be adjusted down when performing multiple hypothesis tests!\n",
    "\n",
    "4.6 **Discuss:** Hypothesize two reasons that could have led to a change in the observed effects. According to the analysis done in **T4.5**, have the effects observed remained the same across the study period? \n",
    "\n",
    "4.7 The features we are studying may interact with each other. For instance, people may like first person singular pronouns in headlines containing positive words (you are amazing!), but dislike headlines with negative words and first person pronouns (you are awful!). To help answer this question, create:\n",
    "- a dataframe containing all A/B tests where both winner and loser headlines include a positive word; and\n",
    "- a dataframe containing all A/B tests where both winner and loser headlines include a negative word;\n",

    "\n",
    "4.9 **Discuss:** Considering the analyses you did throughout Tasks 3 and 4, write a short text (no more than 250 words) giving advice to Upworthy employees on how they should try to write engaging headlines. \n",
    "You can reference images present in the notebook by indicating a task (e.g., image plotted in **T3.3**) or a cell number. Note that you do not need to conduct any additional analysis to write this text. \n"
